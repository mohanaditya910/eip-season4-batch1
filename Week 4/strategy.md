Often models decide the class of objects based on the part of the object. 
These type of models fail when only part of object is visible to the model. 
Hence, a model which decides based on the entire object is desirable one. 

Gradcam tool facilitates in knowing how the model is deciding through a heat map over the image.
This helps us in looking for various options like Cut-out in data augmentation which helps in getting out a generalized model.
